What I like? 

I actually quite liked Scala. Even though I am not used to it, I found it more intuitive than Java. The natlang elements and "sytax options" helped.
Besides the design, I think it also does a good job including functional programming features - although I did not try out things like pattern matching, it is cool that you can do it. 

What I disliked? 

Some things felt unnecesarily different. Like, the way you specify type (:Int). And the lack of return statements just felt... wrong. I felt dirty not putting return statements, even though it worked essentially the same way. It is just a matter of what I am used, to be fair. 
These are not things I particularly disliked, and I got used to them pretty quickly and it grew on me. 

I struggled a bit with the "Random" and "mkString" in the MasterMind program. Like, figuring out how to use "Random" took way longer than everything else, and that is not completely Scala's fault - I don't know. The documentation/design felt lacking there. 

What Scala features would you like to learn more about?
Object Oriented Programming. Also, I just used if then else - so it would be nice to experience some features like pattern matching.
